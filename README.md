# GAI_Project4
This project demonstrates the combination of DDPM and DIP techniques to improve image quality and generation speed. By integrating noise from different time steps of DDPM into DIP training, we aim to enhance the hierarchical representation and reconstruction quality of images. The repository includes experiments with various noise schedules (linear, cosine, quadratic, sigmoid) and provides both quantitative and qualitative results, along with ablation studies to analyze the impact of different components.
# Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Execution

To run the experiments, execute the Jupyter notebook `main.ipynb`.
